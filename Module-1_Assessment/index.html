            <p>My name is Tyler McKay, and I was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, IL! I attended high school and college at Gwendolyn Brooks College Prep and 
                and the University of Illinois at Chicago respectively! I grew up playing basketball and video games as competitive as possible, making multiple varsity level teams as 5'10" center! Now I'm 23 and code in my spare time and own a successful E-Commerce Business.
                Things are pretty exciting as things are looking up in life and in business, especially after graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering!
